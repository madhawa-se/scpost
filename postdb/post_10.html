        object shown in this Chandra X-ray Observatory image (in box) may be an
        elusive intermediate-mass black hole. Located about 32 million 
        light-years from Earth in the Messier 74 galaxy (M74), this object emits
        periodic bursts of x-rays at a rate that suggests it is much larger 
        than a stellar-mass black hole but significantly smaller than the 
        supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies. Few such 
        middling black holes have been discovered, and scientists aren't sure 
        how they form.</p></div>

    <p>Black holes are the cold remnants of former stars, so 
        dense that no matter—not even light—is able to escape their powerful 
        gravitational pull.</p><p><font color="#00FF00">While most stars end up as <strong>white dwarfs</strong> or <strong>neutron stars</strong>,
        black holes are the last evolutionary stage in the lifetimes of 
        enormous stars that had been at least 10 or 15 times as massive as our 
        own sun.</font></p><p>When giant stars reach the final stages of their lives they often detonate in cataclysms known as <strong>supernovae</strong>.
        Such an explosion scatters most of a star into the void of space but 
        leaves behind a large "cold" remnant on which fusion no longer takes 
        place.</p><p>In younger stars, nuclear fusion creates energy and a 
        constant outward pressure that exists in balance with the inward pull of
        gravity caused by the star's own mass. But in the dead remnants of a 
        massive supernova, no force opposes gravity—so the star begins to 
        collapse in upon itself.</p><p>With no force to check gravity, a budding
        black hole shrinks to zero volume—at which point it is infinitely 
        dense. Even the light from such a star is unable to escape its immense 
        gravitational pull. The star's own light becomes trapped in orbit, and 
        the dark star becomes known as a black hole.</p><p>Black holes pull 
        matter and even energy into themselves—but no more so than other stars 
        or cosmic objects of similar mass. That means that a black hole with the
        mass of our own sun would not "suck" objects into it any more than our 
        own sun does with its own gravitational pull.</p><p>Planets, light, and 
        other matter must pass close to a black hole in order to be pulled into 
        its grasp. When they reach a point of no return they are said to have 
        entered the <strong>event horizon</strong>—the point from which any escape is impossible because it requires moving faster than the speed of light.</p><p><strong>Small But Powerful</strong></p><p>Black
        holes are small in size. A million-solar-mass hole, like that believed 
        to be at the center of some galaxies, would have a radius of just about 
        two million miles (three million kilometers)—only about four times the 
        size of the sun. A black hole with a mass equal to that of the sun would
        have a two-mile (three-kilometer) radius.</p><p>Because they are so 
        small, distant, and dark, black holes cannot be directly observed. Yet 
        scientists have confirmed their long-held suspicions that they exist. 
        This is typically done by measuring mass in a region of the sky and 
        looking for areas of large, dark mass.</p><p>Many black holes exist in <strong>binary star systems</strong>.
        These holes may continually pull mass from their neighboring star, 
        growing the black hole and shrinking the other star, until the black 
        hole is large and the companion star has completely vanished.</p><p>Extremely
        large black holes may exist at the center of some galaxies—including 
        our own Milky Way. These massive features may have the mass of 10 to 100
        billion suns. They are similar to smaller black holes but grow to 
        enormous size because there is so much matter in the center of the 
        galaxy for them to add. Black holes can accrue limitless amounts of 
        matter; they simply become even denser as their mass increases.</p><p>Black holes capture the public's imagination and feature prominently in extremely theoretical concepts like <strong>wormholes</strong>. These "tunnels" could allow rapid travel through space and time—but there is no evidence that they exist.</p>
