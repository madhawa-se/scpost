<br></p><p>Founded in 1979, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial 
Intelligence (AAAI) (formerly the American Association for Artificial 
Intelligence) is a nonprofit scientific society devoted to advancing 
the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and 
intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines. AAAI aims to 
promote research in, and responsible use of, artificial intelligence. 
AAAI also aims to increase public understanding of artificial 
intelligence, improve the teaching and training of AI practitioners, 
and provide guidance for research planners and funders concerning the 
importance and potential of current AI developments and future 
directions. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Organization/name-change.php">Moreâ€¦</a></p><p><br></p>
