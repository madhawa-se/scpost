would have been 100 years old this Saturday. To mark the anniversary the
 BBC has commissioned a series of essays. In this, the fourth article, 
his influence on AI research and the resulting controversy are explored.</p><p><br></p><p>Alan Turing was clearly a man ahead of his time. In 1950, at the dawn
 of computing, he was already grappling with the question: "Can machines
 think?" </p><p>This was at a time when the first general purpose computers had only just been built.</p><p>The
 term artificial intelligence had not even been coined. John McCarthy 
would come up with the term in 1956, two years after Alan Turing's 
untimely death.</p><p>Yet his ideas proved both to have a profound 
influence over the new field of AI, and to cause a schism amongst its 
practitioners.</p><p><br></p><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">Knocking down naysayers</h2><p><br></p><p>One of Turing's lasting legacies to AI, and not necessarily a good one, is his approach to the problem of thinking machines.</p><p>He wrote: "I have no very convincing arguments of a positive nature to support my views." </p><p>Instead,
 he turned the tables on those who might be sceptical about the idea of 
machines thinking, unleashing his formidable intellect on a range of 
possible objections, from religion to consciousness.</p><p><br></p>
