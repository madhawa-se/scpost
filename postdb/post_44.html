<p><br></p><p>Eye tracking is possibly the final piece of the VR puzzle. It's not available on the Rift, Vive or PS VR but it will feature in <a href="http://www.wareable.com/vr/fove-eye-tracking-vr-headset-price-specs-release-date-1157">FOVE's very promising VR headset</a>. So how does it work? </p><p><br></p><p>Well,
 an infrared sensor monitor's your eyes inside the headset so FOVE knows
 where your eyes are looking in virtual reality. The main advantage of 
this - apart from allowing in-game characters to more precisely react to
 where you're looking - is to make depth of field more realistic. </p><p><br></p><p>In
 standard VR headsets, everything is in pin-sharp focus which isn't how 
we're used to experiencing the world. If our eyes look at an object in 
the distance, for instance, the foreground blurs and vice versa. By 
tracking our eyes, FOVE's graphics engine can simulate this in a 3D 
space in VR. That's right, blur can be good.</p><p>Headsets still need 
hi-res displays to avoid the effect of looking through a grid. Also what
 our eyes focus on needs to look as life-like as possible. Without eye 
tracking, with everything in focus as you move your eyes - but not your 
head - around a scene, simulation sickness is more likely. Your brain 
knows that something doesn't match up.<br></p>
